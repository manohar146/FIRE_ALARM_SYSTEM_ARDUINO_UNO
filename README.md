# FIRE_ALARM_SYSTEM_ARDUINO_UNO
This project detects fire using a flame sensor and, upon detection, activates a buzzer with a 10-second alternating beep pattern (every 0.5 seconds), displays a warning message on a 16x2 I2C LCD, and logs activity via the Serial Monitor; otherwise, it continuously monitors the environment, shows "No Fire Detected"
